# Why Syntropic Farming

## Syntropic Farming: Why Is It Worth Implementing?

Kokonut Network is committed to a sustainable future, driven by the following key reasons:

1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction**: Greenhouse gases are a major driver of global warming, and the current [industrial food production releases approximately 26% of these emissions.](https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food)
2. **Combating Climate Change**: Merely reducing greenhouse gas emissions is not enough to mitigate climate change. However, it can work effectively in conjunction with soil carbon sequestration by implementing regenerative farm management.
3. **Increased Yields**: Regenerative agriculture strongly promotes organic farming. Organic farms are less susceptible to extreme weather conditions and produce more crops under unfavorable weather conditions than traditional agricultural businesses.
4. **Drought Resilience**: Organic matter retains soil moisture and enhances water retention and infiltration. Building soil organic matter is a central technique in regenerative agriculture.
5. **Support for Local Economies**: Local regenerative agriculture contributes to the development of sustainable local economies.
6. **Biodiversity Conservation**: Versatile species benefit not only the agricultural business but also [environmental sustainability](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2626366?seq=1), which is ultimately essential in regenerative agriculture.
7. **Enhanced Nutritional Value**: The diversity of cultivated crops ensures a more balanced nutrition.

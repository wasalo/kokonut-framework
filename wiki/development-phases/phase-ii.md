# PHASE II

## Production and Regeneration

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### **Implementation of Agro-ecological Practices**

Sustainable methods such as crop rotation, beneficial plant associations, integrated pest management, and organic fertilization are applied to enhance productivity and ecosystem resilience.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Soil Regeneration Initiatives**

Key actions are carried out, including remineralization to replenish essential nutrients, strengthening soil microbiology, using ground cover to prevent erosion, and incorporating organic matter to increase fertility.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Diverse Crop Planting**

Cultivation begins across three production cycle levels:

* **Short cycle:** Fast-growing vegetables that generate biomass and quick yields.
* **Medium cycle:** Crops like passion fruit and pineapple that balance production and regeneration.
* **Long cycle:** Perennial species such as coconut, plantain, banana, and fruit trees (lemon, orange, etc.) establish a strong agroforestry structure.

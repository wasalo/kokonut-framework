#### **What is EBF?**

The Ecological Benefits Framework (EBF) is a new paradigm. It provides a foundational architecture to radically transform global carbon and ecological benefits markets both by increasing transparency, trust, quality, and equity, and by accelerating the coordinated delivery of positive financial and environmental impacts.

By developing a shared framework, EBF can create alignment across public and private sectors to support the rapid deployment of strategic capital for activities that create measurable, life-affirming ecological impacts. The unprecedented coordination of financial markets, UN agencies, NGOs, companies, and philanthropic interests will bring attention to—and help create—a shared pathway for accelerated solutions.

#### **Why do we need a common framework for ecological benefits?**

We need to move out of the Age of Extraction and enter the Age of Regeneration. Over the past 12,000 years, human history has borne witness to the unyielding pursuit of resources through extractive, one-way practices. The repercussions of this Age of Extraction are everywhere: biodiversity collapse, species loss, water scarcity, barren topsoils, unbreathable air, climate change, and the threat of worsening living conditions for hundreds of millions of humans.

#### **Is EBF a data standard or a certification?**

Neither. It is a set of definitions and agreements. Taken together, they form a playbook. Bluetooth is a technology standard. It’s a wireless communication protocol (or digital handshake) that allows any Bluetooth-enabled device (e.g., a cell phone) to communicate with similarly enabled devices (e.g., refrigerators, headphones, televisions, light bulbs, etc.) regardless of manufacturer, brand, or model.

#### **Is this framework for ecological benefits designed to replace carbon markets?**

No, it is an expansion.

The compliance and voluntary carbon markets serve valuable roles by helping interested parties reach their stated objectives related to sustainability, from ESG to compliance, to business and financial goals, while also contributing to the fight against climate change. However, when considered holistically, carbon is part of larger natural systems that include air, water, soil, biodiversity, and equity.

#### **Can the operational efficiency and scale of carbon markets improve by incorporating a shared framework for ecological benefits?**

Projects and claims placed on carbon markets are rewarded for activities that reduce, eliminate, or avoid the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. But GHG emission reductions are not the only benefit happening. Air quality may also improve. Biodiversity may increase. The quality of life in impacted communities may improve for people living in impacted communities.

### CRISP: **Carbon Risk Identification and Scoring Principles**

[**CRISP**](http://www.solid.world/crisp) is an open and transparent framework designed to assess the risks associated with financing science-based carbon credit projects, with a focus on forward carbon credit delivery.

**CRISP OBJECTIVE**: _Capture the risks of non-delivery of forward carbon credit units_

CRISP offers a comprehensive, Creative Commons licensed framework that captures major factors that lead to the non-delivery of carbon credit units by examining crucial risk factors, allowing all stakeholders to make informed decisions while supporting global climate action initiatives.

**Risk Factors scored by CRISP**

1. Carbon Yield Risk
2. Climate Catastrophe Risk
3. Policy and Legal Risk
4. Financial Risk
5. Project Developer Risk

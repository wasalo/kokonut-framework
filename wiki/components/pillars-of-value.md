### Ecological Impact Tracking and Measurement

We track and report on the environmental and social impacts of our project using the [EBF Framework](https://ebfcommons.org/) for Environmental & Social Impact Reports.

We employ several eco-friendly practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance carbon sequestration:

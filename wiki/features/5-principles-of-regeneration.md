# 5 Principles of Regeneration

Kokonut Framework implements various regenerative agriculture techniques, and for this, we consider the five principles defined by [Gabe Brown](https://soilhealthacademy.org/team/gabe-brown/)

1. Elimination of mechanical, chemical, and physical field treatments. This regenerative agriculture principle is associated with pre-industrial farming techniques.
2. Year-round use of cover crops to prevent bare soils and mitigate erosion. This regenerative agriculture method also provides forage and grazing material for poultry and livestock.
3. Enhancement of biodiversity (e.g., through crop rotation, agroforestry, and Silvo-pasture techniques).
4. Incorporation of livestock into agricultural production.
5. Conservation of living roots from perennial crops. These principles aim to ensure a cycle of regenerative agriculture season after season, year after year.

> However, they are not universal, and their combinations and applications depend on the specific characteristics of each particular farm.

### Non-negotiable techniques

* [**Cover Crops**](https://www.fao.org/conservation-agriculture/in-practice/soil-organic-cover/en/): These are crops planted to increase soil fertility, and water retention capacity, enhancing biodiversity, and reducing the potential for pests in the main crop.
* **No-Till Farming**: No-till farming minimizes soil disturbance, reducing soil erosion and carbon dioxide emissions. In this approach, planting is done using specialized drills.
* **Animal Integration in Agricultural Production**: This combination promotes soil fertility, assists in weed and pest management by introducing biological enemies to unwanted species, and benefits the livestock itself, bringing regenerative agriculture closer to wildlife conditions.
* **Perennial Crops**: Perennial crops in regenerative agriculture protect the soil from water and wind erosion by anchoring it with strong roots. They retain moisture and reduce agricultural costs by decreasing plowing and weed control operations.
* **Compost and Compost Tea**: Organic compost provides organic matter and restores soil fertility, a key goal in regenerative organic farming. The optimal concentration of organic matter in the topsoil ranges from 3% to 5% and should be incorporated into the soil profile to a depth of at least six inches. Compost tea is a liquid preparation (hence the name) that introduces vital microorganisms and soluble nutrients essential for plant growth.

# Methodology Positive Impact

### Syntropic Methodology Positive Impacts Highlights

1. It doesn't degrade the soil; on the contrary, the coconut husks are used as fertilizer, and the harvested wood is used for making furniture and other products, not to mention the coconut and its derivatives like milk, water, and oils.
2. The plantations will be home to thousands of birds, bees, and microorganisms, in short, instead of depleting environmental resources, they contribute to biodiversity preservation and water improvement and protection.
3. It promotes a regenerative and environmentally friendly agricultural model, enhancing the quality of life for communities.
4. It advocates for a model where the community is an integral part of the project, directly benefiting from the profits and creating decent employment for hundreds of families.
5. Investment Oversight \[Weekly, Monthly & Real Time Reports]

### Eco-Friendly Agriculture Upsides

* Following Global Climate Goals
* Circular Farming System
* Local Production, Land Use & Biodiversity
* Water, Carbon & Energy

**Advantages of Regenerative Agriculture**

1. Organic Soil Rebuilding and Mineralization, with Fertility Recovery.
2. Carbon Dioxide Absorption.
3. Drastic Reduction in Emissions and Resource Consumption Due to Tillage.
4. Soil Erosion Prevention, Beneficial for Hydrogeological Territory Safety.
5. Groundwater Protection, Thanks to Reduced or Absent Pesticide and Fertilizer Runoff.
6. Reduced Costs Associated with Pesticide Management and Treatments.

> Fertile land also absorbs much more atmospheric CO2 and can store it as carbon in the soil, reducing its atmospheric concentration. This results in purer air to breathe and helps mitigate the greenhouse effect. Furthermore, preserved natural habitats are a necessary condition for biodiversity.
